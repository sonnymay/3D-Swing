# 3D-Swing

Welcome to the 3D-Swing project! This project is a simple 3D simulation of a swing built using Three.js. The swing is fully interactive and can be controlled by the user using the arrow keys or touch controls on mobile devices.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply visit the project website at https://sonnymay.github.io/3D-Swing/ and the simulation will load automatically.

Usage

The swing can be controlled using the arrow keys or touch controls on mobile devices. Pressing the up arrow will make the swing go higher, while pressing the down arrow will make it go lower. Pressing the left arrow will push the swing to the left, while pressing the right arrow will push it to the right.
